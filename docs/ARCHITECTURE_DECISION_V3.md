# ADR: full-resolution proposal-aware methane detector v3

- Status: accepted for the next leakage-safe research experiment; not approved for deployment
- Date: 2026-07-10
- Decision evidence through revision: `26871b20ee3f52107b8c7ab85844383b7f31e9fe`
- Supersedes: the compact primary-research choice in `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md`

## Decision

Train `ersrr_mars_full_unet_proposal_v3` from scratch on the frozen MARS-S2L internal fit groups.
Use a 14,268,915-parameter full-resolution GroupNorm U-Net with three outputs:

1. a dense plume segmentation map;
2. a proposal-aware scene-presence score for plume / abstain / no-plume calibration;
3. an observability score that is not promoted until cloudy and invalid scenes are represented.

The presence descriptor combines deep average/max context, a learned 16-channel component embedding
gathered at high-evidence pixels, and differentiable area, centroid, covariance, compactness, total
variation, and along-/cross-wind shape features. Mask top-k confidence is only an input to this
descriptor, not the decision rule. The same compact dense embedding supports a separately calibrated
connected-component classifier without exporting the full 128-channel decoder tensor.

Do not initialize the primary v3 experiment from the released MARS-S2L checkpoint. That checkpoint
trained on the official training rows from which ERSRR's internal validation groups are drawn, so
warm-starting it would contaminate validation. Released weights remain a fixed external baseline.

## Input and label contract

The input has 16 ordered channels on the native 200 x 200, 10 m MARS grid:

```text
release MBMP
target B02 B03 B04 B08 B11 B12
reference B02 B03 B04 B08 B11 B12
wind_u / 8
wind_v / 8
binary cloud/invalid indicator
```

Sentinel-2 integers are divided by 5,000 and clipped to `[0,2]`, matching the released loader.
Only cloud class `0` and nonzero radiometry are observable. Positive masks are evaluated only on
observable pixels. Methane-enhancement rasters are deliberately absent from detector training: their
units are inconsistent upstream and none of the v3 losses consume them.

Geometric augmentation uses deterministic advancing per-worker streams and rotates/flips the wind
vector with the imagery. Input channel order,
normalization, model metadata, thresholds, checkpoint identity, source manifest identity, and Git
revision are part of the artifact contract.

## Evidence behind the decision

All figures below use the same 579-scene, 150-group strict-spatial development cohort. The released
checkpoints use their authors' fixed `>0.5` / 100-connected-pixel rule; ERSRR thresholds were selected
on internal validation before their one-time strict evaluation.

| Model | Scene recall | Specificity | FPR | AUROC | Pixel AP | Pixel Dice |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MBMP | 0.015 | 0.990 | 0.010 | n/a | 0.0165 | effectively 0 |
| Pixel logistic | 0.000 | 0.988 | 0.012 | n/a | 0.0092 | effectively 0 |
| Joint v1 | 0.015 | 0.914 | 0.086 | n/a | 0.0355 | 0.0983 |
| Joint MIL v2 | 0.149 | 0.988 | 0.012 | 0.752 | 0.0611 | 0.1295 |
| Released CH4Net | 0.164 | 0.912 | 0.088 | 0.597 | 0.0069 | 0.0150 |
| Released MARS-S2L | **0.642** | **0.922** | 0.078 | **0.822** | **0.4943** | **0.5303** |

The released MARS-S2L result proves that full-resolution capacity, bitemporal context, and training
scale matter. CH4Net's failure at nearly the same parameter count proves that capacity alone does not.

### Frozen MARS-S2L publication targets

The current MARS-S2L paper is arXiv `2511.21777v3` (revised 2026-04-24). Its official test set
contains 43,529 images, 1,813 plume images, and 1,289 sites from 2024. At the authors' default scene
threshold of `0.5` and 100 connected pixels, the paper reports:

| Cohort | Images | Plume images | Sites | AP | Recall | FPR | Pixel IoU |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Full official test | 43,529 | 1,813 | 1,289 | 0.6408 | 0.7915 | 0.0713 | 0.3224 |
| Test-only sites | 15,655 | 227 | 697 | 0.4496 | 0.7753 | 0.0763 | not stratified |
| Sites seen during training | 27,874 | 1,586 | 592 | 0.6882 | 0.7938 | 0.0684 | not stratified |

The paper also reports `0.5836` recall at `0.0116` FPR on the full test when the probability
threshold is raised to `0.98`. On the external CloudSEN12+ negative audit (10,434 clear images), its
reported FPR is `0.0943`, `0.0181`, and `0.0052` at thresholds `0.50`, `0.90`, and `0.98`,
respectively. These are separate operating points and must not be mixed in one comparison row.

Sources: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21777) (Tables S1 and S3-S7, S11) and
[released dataset/model card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UNEP-IMEO/MARS-S2L).

The direct ERSRR claim will use a paired, same-cohort comparison after all five seeds are frozen:

1. evaluate released MARS-S2L with its author-fixed `>0.5` / 100-pixel rule on the full 4,401-scene
   strict manifest;
2. evaluate each ERSRR seed once with its validation-frozen threshold and proposal blend;
3. report per-seed results plus a seed-aggregated, 2,000-replicate paired 25 km group bootstrap for
   recall, FPR, AP, calibration, and pixel metrics;
4. report the absolute recall delta and relative FPR reduction against released MARS-S2L;
5. keep the official-paper table above separate because its cohort, prevalence, and threshold policy
   differ from the ERSRR strict test.

The two completed ERSRR seeds currently average `0.8297` validation recall at `0.0490` FPR after
their independently selected proposal blends. This is directionally better than the paper's unseen-site
headline by `+0.0544` recall and `35.8%` relative FPR, but it is internal-validation evidence only and
is not an outperformance claim.

The MIL-v2 internal-validation audit shows why v3 must change the presence mechanism:

- presence versus segmentation top-1% confidence has Spearman rho `0.909`;
- the smallest plume quartile has only `9.4%` presence recall while its mask proposal recall is `59.4%`;
- true-positive median plume area is `1,515` pixels versus `643` for false negatives;
- all 12 false-positive scenes have a saturated mask proposal;
- six of 12 false positives occur in the sampled Kazakhstan stratum;
- MBMP top-1% magnitude is higher for false positives than ordinary true negatives, but nearly equal
  between true and missed plumes.

V3 therefore uses explicit proposal morphology/context, small-plume loss weighting, and group/class
balanced sampling. It does not add another global/top-k pooling variant.

## Leakage-resistant training and evaluation

- Fit: 23,763 samples / 98 frozen 25 km groups / 2,007 positives.
- Internal validation: 5,945 samples / 24 disjoint groups / 505 positives.
- Strict-spatial development benchmark: 4,401 samples / 150 groups, retained only for a frozen-candidate evaluation.
- Independent confirmation: untouched time-aligned EMIT V002 groups after the architecture and thresholds are frozen.

The minimum v3 corpus contains image, cloud-mask, and positive plume-mask assets only. It totals
61,928 assets / 30,366,803,325 bytes (28.281 GiB); the verified development tranche reuses 2,688
assets, leaving 29,198,856,248 bytes (27.193 GiB) to download.

Checkpoint selection maximizes validation recall subject to observed FPR <= 0.05, then validation AP
and positive-mask Dice. Small positive examples receive bounded inverse-square-root area weighting.
No strict-test result may change the architecture, loss, threshold, or component rule.

## Promotion boundary

V3 is not an operational detector until all of the following hold:

1. group-bootstrap lower 95% recall bound at least 0.75;
2. FPR at most 0.05 and specificity at least 0.95 on representative negatives;
3. at least 25% relative FPR reduction versus the strongest reproduced baseline at non-inferior recall;
4. calibrated plume/no-plume thresholds with explicit abstention and accepted no-plume NPV;
5. five fixed seeds and site-block confidence intervals;
6. unchanged performance claims on an untouched, time-aligned EMIT V002 confirmation cohort;
7. a model card limiting supported sensor, product level, preprocessing, and operating thresholds.

Until those gates pass, the web application must continue to label model output as research-only and
must not silently replace the packaged legacy artifact with v3.
