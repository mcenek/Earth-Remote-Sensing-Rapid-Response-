# ERSRR publication roadmap: reliable plume detection and no-plume rejection

- Status: execution active; frozen MARS-S2L protocol, baselines, and joint MIL v2 recorded
- Date: 2026-07-10
- Starting revision: `3cab591405cf59287a76249c12e08ca4e82f6855`
- Current artifact: `research_only`; it is an engineering baseline, not the paper model

## Executive decision

The project should stop optimizing the existing positive-only legacy cohort. Its calibrated
artifact has specificity `0.00127`, so it cannot make a credible no-plume decision. The next
research system should be built around:

1. the public MARS-S2L dataset as the primary real Sentinel-2/Landsat training and benchmark
   corpus;
2. the current compact ERSRR model, MBMP, CH4Net, and the released MARS-S2L model as explicit
   baselines;
3. a dual-temporal, physics-guided detector with separate scene-presence and pixel-segmentation
   heads;
4. hard-negative mining and validation-only risk calibration;
5. an independent EMIT V002 concentration/sensitivity/uncertainty cohort for external validation;
6. a three-state prediction contract: `PLUME`, `NO_PLUME`, or
   `UNOBSERVABLE_OR_UNCERTAIN`.

The paper should not claim that lack of a catalog entry proves methane absence. `NO_PLUME` is
allowed only when the scene is observable, passes the quality contract, and has a reviewed
negative label. Cloudy, invalid, temporally ambiguous, or low-sensitivity scenes must abstain.

## Proposed paper

Working title:

> Coverage-aware negative sampling and risk-controlled physics-guided learning for methane
> plume detection in Sentinel-2 imagery

Primary research question:

> Can a dual-temporal detector trained with real hard negatives reduce false alarms at matched
> plume recall, while retaining pixel-level plume delineation and generalizing to geographically
> and sensor-disjoint observations?

Planned contributions:

1. A reproducible label contract that separates plume, reviewed no-plume, uncertain, and
   unobservable scenes.
2. A source- and geography-disjoint benchmark with explicit negative examples and a frozen
   external EMIT V002 evaluation cohort.
3. A physics-guided target/reference model with scene-presence, segmentation, and observability
   outputs.
4. A predeclared operating point and selective prediction rule that controls false positives
   instead of maximizing F1 after seeing the test set.
5. A full error analysis by region, surface type, cloud regime, plume size, temporal gap, and
   source-site novelty.

Atmospheric Measurement Techniques (AMT) is the primary venue because the paper is a retrieval,
validation, and data-processing method. Remote Sensing of Environment is a stretch venue if the
external validation and generalization results are unusually strong. AMT requires a data/code
availability section and recommends DOI-backed FAIR repositories for the code and evidence:
<https://www.atmospheric-measurement-techniques.net/submission.html>.

## Current evidence and why the plan changes

- The legacy ERSRR data contains 102 positive-centered tiles and no verified true negatives.
- Only 65 legacy scenes in 32 connected split groups pass the current validity/time-gap filter.
- Raw logistic regression outranks the compact raw ResUNet on both tested legacy thresholds.
- The packaged ResUNet predicts almost everywhere positive at its calibrated threshold.
- The public V002 pilot proves the acquisition path but leaves only six complete plume groups.
- Non-contemporaneous EMIT polygons cannot be copied onto nearby Sentinel-2 dates and treated as
  time-correct plume truth.
- The native MARS adapter smoke test runs end to end on 18 balanced samples, but validation-tuned
  MBMP and pixel-logistic rules each produced two false alarms among three test negatives. This
  pilot is too small for an accuracy estimate, yet it confirms that a segmentation threshold alone
  is not a credible no-plume decision rule.
- A verified 1,731-scene development tranche now exercises 768 internal-training, 384
  group-disjoint validation, and 579 strict-spatial benchmark scenes. At validation FPR <= 0.05,
  MBMP, raw logistic, physics logistic, and physics gradient boosting achieved only 0.8%-14.1%
  validation recall. The validation-selected raw logistic reached 7.5% recall / 96.3% specificity
  on the spatial benchmark. Aggregate scene statistics are therefore inadequate; the next model
  must learn spatial plume morphology jointly with presence and observability.
- The spatial baseline closes the remaining classical loophole. Validation-selected pixel
  logistic achieved 3.9% recall at 3.1% FPR and then 0% recall on the spatial benchmark; MBMP
  achieved 0.8% validation recall and 1.5% benchmark recall. Both have effectively zero pixel IoU.
  Connected-component filtering cannot rescue a classifier without a learned spatial receptive
  field.
- Joint model v1 verifies that learned spatial context helps masks but not yet operational scene
  decisions. It raises strict-spatial pixel AP to 0.0355 and IoU to 0.0517, but its
  validation-selected presence rule transfers at only 1.5% recall / 91.4% specificity. The best
  checkpoint occurs at epoch 1 because global-average scene pooling quickly overfits. The next
  frozen change was therefore top-k multiple-instance plume evidence plus stronger presence loss,
  not a wider/deeper encoder.
- Joint MIL v2 validates that architecture call. It reaches 39.8% validation recall at 4.7% FPR,
  versus 4.7% recall for v1 at a comparable validation constraint. With its checkpoint and
  thresholds frozen before test evaluation, it reaches 14.9% strict-spatial recall, 98.8%
  specificity, 0.752 AUROC, and 0.0611 pixel AP. This is a 10x recall improvement over v1 while
  reducing v1's strict FPR from 8.6% to 1.2%. However, the group-bootstrap recall 95% interval is
  only 4.4%-35.0%, so the promotion gate still fails. The next decision must come from the released
  MARS-S2L baseline and validation-only error analysis, not from further inspection of this frozen
  benchmark.
- The pinned released MARS-S2L checkpoint establishes the credible scale baseline. Using the
  authors' fixed >0.5 / 100-pixel connected-component rule without ERSRR recalibration, it reaches
  64.2% recall, 92.2% specificity, 0.822 AUROC, 0.494 pixel AP, and 0.530 pixel Dice on the same 579
  strict-spatial scenes. The group-bootstrap recall interval is 48.0%-86.1% and FPR is 7.8%, so it
  also fails the ERSRR research gate. It nevertheless outperforms MIL v2 decisively and shows that
  the next candidate must inherit full-resolution U-Net capacity and substantially broader
  training data while adding a separately calibrated high-specificity presence/abstention head.
- The released single-date CH4Net checkpoint confirms that the gain is not generic U-Net capacity:
  on the same strict cohort it reaches only 16.4% recall, 91.2% specificity, 0.597 AUROC, and 0.0069
  pixel AP. Target/reference pairing, MBMP/wind/cloud context, and the MARS data program are therefore
  essential ablations. Phase 2 baseline reproduction is complete.
- The internal-validation-only MIL-v2 audit explains why another pooling adjustment is not the
  answer. Presence score is coupled to segmentation top-1% confidence at Spearman rho=0.909. The
  smallest plume quartile reaches only 9.4% presence recall even though the mask rule proposes a
  component in 59.4% of those scenes; median true-positive plume area is 1,515 pixels versus 643
  for false negatives. All 12 false positives have saturated mask proposals, and six occur in one
  Kazakhstan stratum. MBMP top-1% strength is higher for false positives than for ordinary true
  negatives but is nearly identical between true and missed plumes. The next head must classify
  connected proposals using morphology, multiscale context, wind alignment, and geography-balanced
  hard negatives rather than treating top-k mask confidence or MBMP magnitude as presence.
- V3 is implemented as a 14,268,915-parameter full-resolution GroupNorm U-Net trained from scratch,
  with proposal descriptors combining deep global context, decoder features at high-evidence
  pixels through a learned 16-channel component embedding, soft area/centroid/covariance/compactness,
  and along-/cross-wind variance. Positive
  presence loss upweights small plumes by valid mask area. A 64-train/32-validation, group-disjoint
  one-epoch smoke run completed the enhancement-free adapter, augmentation-aware wind rotation,
  GPU training, checkpoint, and validation-rule pipeline; it explicitly did not load the strict
  benchmark and its metrics are not accuracy evidence. Full v3 training now depends on the frozen
  27.193 GiB remaining fit/validation transfer.

The current shared core and artifact contract remain useful engineering infrastructure. They do
not establish a useful detector.

## Data program

### 1. Primary corpus: MARS-S2L

Authoritative dataset:
<https://huggingface.co/datasets/UNEP-IMEO/MARS-S2L>

Companion code:
<https://github.com/UNEP-IMEO-MARS/marss2l>

Reference paper:
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21777>

The dataset card reports approximately 87,000 target/background Sentinel-2 and Landsat image
pairs, more than 5,600 manually verified plumes, explicit cloud masks, plume masks and methane
enhancement for positive cases, and about 100 GB total storage. It includes official train,
validation, and test splits. The license is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. As checked on 2026-07-10, the
repository is public and ungated.

The pinned local audit now provides exact counts. The official split union contains 87,887 image
items: 5,643 plume positives and 82,244 reviewed negatives. A first S2-only, clear,
`percentage_clear >= 80`, background-present cohort contains 56,552 items (3,826 positive and
52,726 negative). It has 29,708 train, 5,527 validation, and 21,317 test items. The official
splits have no exact scene overlap, but they do share physical locations: 89 train/validation,
592 train/test, and 84 validation/test. The final protocol is stricter than physical-site novelty:
the primary geographic-transfer result uses only official-test rows whose connected 25 km group
contains no official-train row. The test-only-location view is secondary, while the full official
test is retained for released-benchmark comparison.
See `reports/acquisition/MARS_S2L_METADATA_AUDIT.md` for the reproducible evidence.

```

Local destination, already beneath an ignored acquisition root:

```text
EarthRemoteSensingRapidResponse/Data Collection/s2_emit_pairs/
  publication-v1/external/MARS-S2L/
```

Download and verify only the pinned metadata first (188,857,049 bytes):

```bash
python tools/acquire_mars_metadata.py
python tools/acquire_mars_metadata.py --verify-only
python tools/audit_mars_metadata.py
```

The audit gate passed for selective S2 ingestion. Do not mirror the full mixed-sensor 100 GB
repository: the first paper experiment neither needs Landsat nor the 5,651 rows outside the
official splits. Before a large transfer, generate a cohort manifest from the criteria above,
freeze its sample IDs and asset URLs, estimate its byte size, obtain storage approval, and fetch
only its image/cloud-mask assets plus positive plume/enhancement assets.

That inventory is now frozen at 56,552 samples and 120,756 unique assets totaling exactly
58,455,597,233 bytes (58.456 GB / 54.441 GiB). Rebuild or verify it without downloading imagery:

```bash
python tools/build_mars_cohort.py
python tools/build_mars_cohort.py --offline
```

The detailed ignored manifest and catalog are stored as
`publication_s2_cohort.jsonl` and `publication_s2_remote_catalog.jsonl` under the local MARS path.
Their hashes and the compact evidence are in
`reports/acquisition/MARS_S2L_PUBLICATION_COHORT.md`.

After explicitly accepting the 54.441 GiB transfer, run the pinned resumable downloader from the
repository root:

```bash
python tools/acquire_mars_cohort.py --dry-run
python tools/acquire_mars_cohort.py
python tools/acquire_mars_cohort.py --verify-only
```

It verifies every LFS asset with the repository-declared SHA-256, verifies small assets with their
Git blob SHA-1, resumes `.part` files, rejects path escape, reserves 5 GiB of free space, and never
writes outside the ignored MARS acquisition directory. No Hugging Face account or token is needed.

The full all-split inventory is no longer the recommended next transfer. The validation error audit
shows that v3 first needs only the leakage-resistant internal fit and validation roles. A frozen
minimum v3 corpus excludes unused methane-enhancement rasters and contains 29,708 samples / 61,928
assets / exactly 30,366,803,325 bytes (28.281 GiB). The verified development tranche reuses 2,688
of those assets, leaving exactly 59,240 assets / 29,198,856,248 bytes (27.193 GiB) to download.
Build and acquire that exact catalog with:

```bash
python tools/build_mars_v3_training_cohort.py
python tools/acquire_mars_cohort.py --catalog-file publication_v3_training_remote_catalog.jsonl --dry-run
python tools/acquire_mars_cohort.py --catalog-file publication_v3_training_remote_catalog.jsonl --receipt reports/acquisition/mars_s2l_v3_training_download.json
python tools/acquire_mars_cohort.py --catalog-file publication_v3_training_remote_catalog.jsonl --verify-only --receipt reports/acquisition/mars_s2l_v3_training_download.json
```

The manifest/catalog SHA-256 values and zero group-overlap evidence are recorded in
`reports/acquisition/MARS_S2L_V3_TRAINING_COHORT.md`. Use the full 54.441 GiB catalog only later if
official-split comparability or additional test-side error analysis is explicitly required.

The deterministic 18-sample contract pilot is already available locally and can be independently
verified and audited with:

```bash
python tools/acquire_mars_pilot.py --verify-only
# Run from the repository root inside WSL:
.venv/bin/python tools/audit_mars_pilot.py
```

The pilot verifies 54 files / 19,835,687 bytes across 18 balanced samples with zero contract
violations. Its native image is a 200 x 200, 10 m, 12-band `uint16` stack: target and background
each contain `B02,B03,B04,B08,B11,B12`. Positive samples additionally contain a binary plume mask
and an enhancement raster; negatives intentionally omit both. The enhancement unit metadata is
internally inconsistent: populated TIFF descriptions say `DeltaCH4(ppm)`, while the pinned MARS
README says ppb. Preserve raw values but prohibit quantitative regression/flux claims until the
producer resolves the unit. Some ancillary rasters also lack band
descriptions, and cloud-mask nodata metadata can overlap the clear class, so the adapter must use
manifest roles and explicit mask values rather than GDAL validity masks. See
`reports/acquisition/MARS_S2L_CONTRACT_PILOT.md`.

Do not copy this corpus into the tracked `Dataset/` directory. Track only a derived manifest,
license record, pinned revision, checksums, split/group audit, and experiment summaries.

### 2. External validation: EMIT CH4ENH and CH4PLM V002

EMIT V002 enhancement is particularly valuable because it contains all captured scenes,
including scenes without a detected plume complex, and provides enhancement, uncertainty, and
sensitivity COGs. NASA describes the enhancement in `ppm m`, at nominal 60 m resolution:

- CH4ENH V002 collection: <https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C3242680113-LPCLOUD>
- CH4PLM V002 collection: <https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C3242707413-LPCLOUD>
- V002 product guide: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2250/EMIT_L2B_GHG_User_Guide_V2.pdf>
- Earthdata account registration: <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new>

Earthdata metadata and browse imagery are public, but the science COGs require a free Earthdata
Login. Credentials must never be placed in this repository or pasted into a task. Use a browser
session or user-managed Earthdata credential store.

Local destination:

```text
EarthRemoteSensingRapidResponse/Data Collection/EMIT_Plumes/publication-v1/
  CH4ENH/<enhancement-scene-id>/
  CH4PLM/<plume-complex-id>/
```

For each CH4ENH scene, download the three protected science files listed by the official V2
product guide:

```text
EMIT_L2B_CH4ENH_002_<timestamp>_<orbit>_<scene>.tif
EMIT_L2B_CH4UNCERT_002_<timestamp>_<orbit>_<scene>.tif
EMIT_L2B_CH4SENS_002_<timestamp>_<orbit>_<scene>.tif
```

The generic `.cmr.json` response may be retained as optional catalog evidence, but it is not a
fourth science layer. For each CH4PLM complex, download the plume COG and use its embedded tags plus
the tracked public CMR batch for the label contract. Preserve the NASA filenames unchanged.

The first authenticated pilot should cover the 12 public plume complexes already collected and
their exact source enhancement scenes:

| CH4PLM V002 complex | Source CH4ENH V002 scene |
|---|---|
| `EMIT_L2B_CH4PLM_002_20241017T083946_003674` | `EMIT_L2B_CH4ENH_002_20241017T083946_2429106_009` |

Authenticated acquisition is now complete for this pilot: 12 CH4PLM rasters and all 36 CH4ENH,
uncertainty, and sensitivity COGs are present beneath the ignored acquisition root. The protected
science files total 401,019,760 bytes. All 12 three-product source grids align, and every CH4PLM
valid pixel exactly matches an integer-offset crop of its declared CH4ENH source scene. See
`reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_AUTHENTICATED_PLUME_AUDIT.md` and
`reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_AUTHENTICATED_SCIENCE_AUDIT.md`.

This pilot is for validating units, nodata, sensitivity correction, raster alignment, and label
construction. It is not large enough for the final paper.

### 3. Optional external corroboration

Carbon Mapper provides public plume/source metadata and imagery through its portal, STAC, and API.
API registration is available at <https://data.carbonmapper.org/register>; documentation is at
<https://api.carbonmapper.org/api/v1/docs>. Its current terms are non-commercial and require
attribution. If used, store exports under:

```text
EarthRemoteSensingRapidResponse/Data Collection/s2_emit_pairs/
  publication-v1/external/carbon-mapper/
```

Carbon Mapper is a corroborating catalog or external test source, not proof that an unlisted scene
contains no plume.

STARCOP and GeoCH4PlumeNet are useful optional ablations, not primary truth for this Sentinel-2
paper:

- STARCOP real hyperspectral benchmark: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7863343>
- GeoCH4PlumeNet synthetic Sentinel-2 benchmark: <https://zenodo.org/records/16813369>

## Label and observability contract

Each sample must have one of four mutually exclusive labels:

| State | Required evidence | Permitted model output |
|---|---|---|
| `PLUME` | Reviewed S2 plume mask or sufficiently time-aligned high-confidence external detection | plume probability and mask |
| `NO_PLUME` | Observable reviewed negative from the same data domain | zero mask and calibrated no-plume confidence |
| `UNCERTAIN` | Conflicting, weak, temporally ambiguous, or single-annotator evidence | abstain |
| `UNOBSERVABLE` | Cloud, invalid coverage, low sensitivity, missing reference, or severe artifact | abstain |

An EMIT detection at time `t` is not automatically a Sentinel-2 plume label at `t +/- 1 day`.
External positive transfer should target `|delta t| <= 6 h`; `6-24 h` is exploratory and must be
reported separately; larger offsets cannot enter the locked test. Negative transfer is even more
strict: no EMIT plume at a different time cannot prove no plume in the Sentinel-2 image.

For new manually reviewed S2 labels:

- require two independent annotators for the locked test;
- preserve each original mask and adjudication record;
- report inter-annotator IoU and presence agreement;
- include hard negative categories: thin cloud, cloud shadow, water edges, bright surfaces,
  agricultural patterns, burn scars, sensor striping, and heterogeneous SWIR backgrounds;
- never convert an unlabeled image into a negative.

## Dataset and split contract

The tracked manifest should contain, at minimum:

```text
sample_id, source_dataset, source_revision, license, sensor, product_level,
target_scene_id, reference_scene_id, target_datetime, reference_datetime,
band_order, radiometric_scale, crs, transform, valid_mask, cloud_fraction,
label_state, label_source, label_confidence, plume_id, physical_source_id,
region_id, enhancement_units, sensitivity_path, uncertainty_path,
split, group_id, source_urls, checksums
```

Split rules:

1. Preserve the full official MARS-S2L validation/test sets for comparability; never tune on either.
2. Group by connected components sharing physical source, a 25 km geographic neighborhood,
   acquisition sequence, or near-duplicate imagery.
3. Split the released training rows into a deterministic internal train/validation partition by
   complete 25 km group. Fit normalization, class weights, thresholds, component area, and
   calibrators on those internal roles only.
4. Use as the primary test only official-test groups with no official-train member. Report the
   full official test and test-only-location views as explicitly weaker secondary comparisons.
5. Keep EMIT V002 and Carbon Mapper external tests untouched until the model and operating point
   are frozen.
6. Deduplicate against the current ERSRR corpus and all external catalogs before splitting.

The frozen machine-readable protocol is `configs/mars_publication_protocol.json`. Its ignored
56,552-row assignment manifest has SHA-256
`49d48669c765f06555f90a9fb94647e4983cbce13a983805e5fa440310c11671`. Exact roles are:

- internal training: 23,763 rows / 98 groups / 2,007 plume;
- internal validation: 5,945 rows / 24 groups / 505 plume;
- strict 25 km test: 4,401 rows / 150 groups / 67 plume / 4,334 no plume;
- official validation and the remaining 16,916 overlapping official-test rows: comparability only.

Both enforced group-overlap invariants are zero. See
`reports/acquisition/MARS_S2L_EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md`.

The predeclared classical/physics baseline ladder may inspect the MARS strict-spatial benchmark,
but candidate architecture and threshold selection remain internal-validation-only. The final
independent confirmation is the untouched time-aligned EMIT V002 cohort, evaluated only after the
candidate architecture and operating rule are frozen.

## Model architecture hypothesis

The current compact raw ResUNet remains a five-band single-time baseline. The released-checkpoint
result rules out another compact shared-encoder iteration as the primary path. The next paper
candidate is a full-resolution dual-temporal selective U-Net trained from scratch on the frozen
fit groups. The released checkpoint remains a baseline only because its training corpus overlaps
ERSRR internal-validation scenes:

```text
target + reference + MBMP + wind + cloud --> full U-Net --> segmentation decoder --> plume mask
                                                   |       component embedding --> fixed proposals
                                                   |       top-k + geometry ----> neural ablation head
validity mask -------------------------------------|---------------------------> masked losses
fixed proposals + shape/spectral/wind context --> calibrated classifier ------> scene decision
```

Initial input contract:

- native MARS target and reference Sentinel-2 observations on one 200 x 200, 10 m grid;
- six declared bands per date: B02/B03/B04/B08/B11/B12, plus separately derived MBMP/retrieval
  channels;
- cloud/validity masks as explicit channels; temporal gap retained for stratified analysis rather
  than silently introduced as an untested neural feature;
- manifest-declared asset roles and explicit cloud classes; never infer clear/invalid solely from
  ancillary-raster nodata metadata;
- no silent L1C/L2A mixing;
- S2-only experiments first; Landsat is a later cross-sensor extension.

Heads and training:

- retain the released 13.6M-parameter full-resolution U-Net as the capacity baseline instead of
  widening the undertrained 2.75M-parameter shared encoder;
- connected-proposal presence head trained on balanced positives and real hard negatives;
- proposal evidence combines decoder features, component shape/area, surrounding multiscale
  context, target/reference change, and wind alignment; top-k/max mask confidence is retained only
  as an input, not the decision statistic;
- segmentation loss evaluated only where the target and annotation are valid;
- observability/quality head trained to reject invalid scenes;
- connected hard-negative extraction after the frozen neural pass;
- class-balanced sampling by source and region, not by pixel;
- deep ensemble or repeated-seed ensemble for epistemic uncertainty;
- validation-only calibration with separate low/high thresholds for no-plume, abstain, and plume.

The native adapter follows the released implementation at inspected commit
`f7d264c2c845dfba1cb27f76ef6026275f8d8758`: divide TOA integers by 5,000, clip to `[0,2]`, and
compute MBMP from separately median-normalized B12/B11 target and background ratios. ERSRR also
computes a validity-aware MBMP variant whose medians exclude cloud and radiometrically invalid
pixels. Both must remain explicit ablations.

The released MARS-S2L model is now reproduced and establishes that capacity plus data scale is the
dominant gap. V3 therefore matches that capacity class while training a new ERSRR model from
scratch under the leakage-safe group protocol. Prithvi, SatMAE, DOFA, or SegFormer remains a later
ablation only if this full-data candidate fails under the same contract.

## Experiment ladder

| ID | Experiment | Purpose | Promotion gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| E0 | Prior, raw logistic, MBMP threshold | Detect leakage and metric bugs | Above prevalence/chance on frozen validation |
| E1 | Existing compact single-time raw ResUNet | Retain current baseline | Reproduce recorded grouped result |
| E2 | Released CH4Net and MARS-S2L checkpoints | Establish credible state of the art | Reproduce published evaluation protocol within tolerance |
| E3 | Dual-temporal raw model | Test temporal information | Beat E1 on site-blocked AUPRC and false-positive rate |
| E4 | Dual-temporal raw + MBMP physics channel | Test physics guidance | Beat E3 at matched recall |
| E5 | Presence head + hard-negative mining | Improve no-plume rejection | At least 25% relative FPR reduction without worse recall CI |
| E6 | Selective calibration / ensemble | Control operational risk | Meet locked recall/FPR and calibration gates |
| E7 | Leave-one-region-out and EMIT V002 external test | Test generalization | Improvement survives unseen sites/regions |
| E8 | Optional pretrained backbone | Test scale/transfer | Added value exceeds variance and compute cost |

Every learned experiment should use at least five fixed seeds. Report all seeds, not only the best.

## Predeclared metrics and success gates

The primary endpoint is scene-level plume recall at a fixed no-plume false-positive rate. Pixel F1
alone is not sufficient.

Required metrics:

- scene: precision, recall, specificity, negative predictive value, AUPRC, AUROC, Brier score,
  expected calibration error, and false positives per 100 observable scenes;
- plume object: precision/recall, detection probability by plume area/enhancement/flux bucket, and
  source-localization error;
- segmentation: IoU, Dice/F1, pixel average precision, false-positive area, and boundary error;
- selective prediction: coverage versus risk, abstention rate, and errors among accepted
  `NO_PLUME` decisions;
- stratified: unseen site, region, surface heterogeneity, cloud fraction, temporal gap, sensor,
  plume size, and enhancement strength.

Statistics:

- 95% confidence intervals from a block bootstrap over physical source sites, not pixels;
- paired comparisons on identical test scenes;
- at least five fixed training seeds for learned models;
- no test-set threshold selection;
- publish failures and per-region results.

Minimum research promotion gate:

- lower 95% confidence bound for scene recall at least 0.75 at scene FPR no greater than 0.05;
- no-plume specificity at least 0.95 on representative reviewed negatives;
- at least 25% relative FPR reduction versus the strongest reproduced baseline at non-inferior
  recall, or a clearly novel external-benchmark contribution if that model lift is not achieved;
- positive performance above prevalence and simple retrieval baselines in every primary test;
- a usable calibration curve and explicit abstention behavior;
- no unresolved source/geographic leakage.

Stretch target: at least 0.85 scene recall at no more than 0.03 FPR on unseen sites. These are
targets, not current claims. For context, the current MARS-S2L paper reports 78% plume recall and
8% false-positive rate at 697 previously unseen sites.

## Execution phases

### Phase 0 - freeze the protocol (2-3 days)

- [x] Convert this plan into a machine-readable experiment specification.
- [x] Define the four label states and primary metric before training.
- [x] Record dataset licenses and immutable source revisions.

Exit: signed-off protocol and no ambiguity about what `NO_PLUME` means.

### Phase 1 - ingest and audit MARS-S2L (1 week)

- Download and verify pinned metadata, then build a frozen selective S2 cohort manifest.
- Estimate and approve the selective transfer before downloading its assets; do not mirror the
  full mixed-sensor corpus.
- Build a read-only dataset adapter; do not rewrite 100 GB into another raw copy.
- Audit class balance, sites, regions, product levels, bands, temporal pairs, clouds, duplicates,
  official splits, and missing assets.
- Generate a small tracked manifest and integrity report.

Exit: every sample resolves to a state, group, split, checksum, and product contract.

### Phase 2 - reproduce baselines (1-2 weeks)

- Implement MBMP under the same grid and masks.
- Run CH4Net and released MARS-S2L checkpoints.
- Run the current compact ERSRR model as a controlled baseline.
- Reproduce official split metrics before designing a new network.

Exit: credible baseline table and documented discrepancies from published values.

Current development status: native MBMP, raw/physics scene and pixel-logistic, joint v1/MIL-v2,
released CH4Net, and released MARS-S2L baselines are complete and frozen. Released MARS-S2L is the
strongest detector but still fails the recall-confidence and FPR gates; CH4Net is substantially
weaker. Phase 2 is complete. Any subsequent ERSRR change must be selected on internal validation
or new external data, not on the already reported strict-spatial development benchmark.

### Phase 3 - hard-negative and architecture experiments (2-4 weeks)

- Add the target/reference data path.
- Run E3-E6 in order, stopping variants that fail gates.
- Mine and categorize validation false positives without touching test data.
- Freeze architecture, seeds, and operating thresholds.

Exit: one selected model with a fixed artifact contract and no test-set tuning.

Current status: v3 code and unit/integration smoke tests are complete. The full from-scratch run is
waiting only for the minimum v3 asset catalog documented above; released weights will not be used
because they would leak official-train samples into ERSRR internal validation.

Once the verification receipt reports every selected asset valid, run the primary seed in WSL at
the measured RTX 5070 throughput point. The trainer writes only an ignored checkpoint and compact
tracked validation evidence; it cannot load the strict cohort:

```bash
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 .venv/bin/python tools/train_mars_v3.py \
  --batch-size 24 --workers 8 --epochs 40 --patience 7 --seed 303
```

Then fit the connected-component false-alarm classifier. Its gradient-boosted proposal model is fit
on internal-training groups, Platt-calibrated on a deterministic held-out subset of those groups,
with class/group-balanced weights, and thresholded only on the disjoint internal validation role.
The boosted classifier uses a fixed iteration budget rather than a proposal-random early-stopping
split. Ambiguous-overlap proposals are
excluded from classifier fitting but retained in scene scoring, because deployment cannot use truth
to remove them:

```bash
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 .venv/bin/python tools/train_mars_v3_proposals.py \
  --batch-size 24 --workers 8
```

Only after both validation artifacts are committed and frozen may the separate strict evaluator be
run. It rejects smoke checkpoints and verifies the checkpoint, source, manifest, and validation
report hashes before scoring. Its primary decision score is the maximum calibrated connected-
proposal probability; `--neural-only` is an explicitly labeled ablation:

The final MARS estimate uses the complete 4,401-scene / 150-group strict-spatial role, not the
class-enriched 579-scene development tranche. Its minimum detector-only transfer contains 8,869
assets / 4,489,575,260 bytes; 1,225 assets are already verified, leaving 7,644 assets /
3,911,945,490 bytes (3.643 GiB):

```

  --batch-size 24 --workers 8
```

### Phase 4 - independent EMIT V002 validation (2-3 weeks)

- [x] Validate the 12 authenticated pilot bundles and freeze the enhancement/sensitivity/uncertainty
  raster contract.
- [x] Build the external reader and time-aligned candidate manifest without inspecting
  frozen-model predictions.
- [x] Use public CMR/STAC metadata to select a larger, prediction-blind candidate set before
  protected downloading. The frozen discovery pass found 124 strict-time/FOV matches and retained
  70 unique-source, unique-Sentinel-2, 25 km-independent candidates with zero query errors. Every
  plume complex fits the native 2 km model field of view. The 50% catalog-cloud ceiling is only a
  search prefilter; accepted samples still require at least 70% local clear support. See
  `reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_TIME_ALIGNED_CANDIDATES.md`.
- [x] Freeze product-matched Sentinel-2 pairs for all 70 candidates: six-band L1C target/reference
  radiometry with co-temporal L2A SCL used only for observability. All targets and references are
  unique, all references are prior same-tile acquisitions, and the actual maximum lookback is 30
  days; see `reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_L1C_PAIRS.md`.
- [x] Acquire and SHA-256 verify all 70 public native-grid L1C target/reference crops and
  co-temporal L2A SCL masks. The prediction-blind preliminary gate retained 60 scenes with zero
  acquisition errors; see `reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_L1C_RASTER_GATE.md`.
- [x] Reproduce MARS Sentinel-2 cloud preprocessing with the exact 13-band CloudSEN12+
  `UNetMobV2_V2` weights. All 60 preliminary gate-pass masks are hash-bound; see
  `reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_CLOUDSEN12_ACQUISITION.md`.
- [x] Seal the exact-model-input cohort before methane inference. Requiring at least 70% valid
  target/reference radiometry and CloudSEN12-clear support both globally and over the EMIT plume
  retains 55 independent scenes; see `reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_EXTERNAL_COHORT_SEAL.md`.
- [x] Freeze 70 official ERA5-Land 10-m `u`/`v` wind requests; all 70 payloads pass the public CDS
  costing/schema endpoint. Authenticated retrieval remains pending a user-managed CDS token; see
  `reports/acquisition/EMIT_V002_ERA5_WIND_REQUESTS.md`.
- Retain only time-aligned, observable examples; label ambiguous cases as uncertain. The 55-scene
  sealed cohort is positive confirmation, not a no-plume benchmark.
- Have two annotators review the locked external cohort.
- Run the frozen model exactly once for primary reporting.

Exit: at least 50 independent external source/region groups, or an explicit feasibility result if
the strict time-alignment gate yields fewer cases.

### Phase 5 - paper and release (2-3 weeks)

- Run five seeds and site-block bootstrap intervals.
- Produce error-atlas, calibration, PR, geography, and ablation figures.
- Archive code/config/manifests/derived labels with a DOI; do not redistribute restricted raw data.
- Write AMT-format Methods, Results, limitations, code availability, and data availability.
- Release a model card that says exactly which sensors/products and operating thresholds are valid.

Exit: a fully reproducible manuscript package, not just a model checkpoint.

Expected duration: roughly 8-13 focused weeks after the full data is available. The schedule is
data- and gate-dependent; failed ablations should shorten it rather than trigger architecture
shopping.

## Immediate handoff

### User action required

1. Sign in at <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land-timeseries?tab=download>,
   accept the CC-BY terms, and configure the personal token in WSL `$HOME/.cdsapirc` following
   <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api>. Never put the token in chat or this repository.
   The committed tool will acquire the data; no manual file placement is required.
2. No further Earthdata action is currently required. The authenticated 12-scene science-contract
   pilot is downloaded, ignored, checksum-bound, and audited; the larger positive-confirmation
   cohort uses public CMR plume geometry.

### Work that does not require user credentials

- Pinned metadata, the full selective v3 fit/validation transfer, the full 4,401-scene strict
  transfer, and both released/MIL-v2 checkpoint baselines are downloaded and verified. Raw data
  remain ignored and only compact receipts are committed.
- The MARS adapter, group/leakage protocol, classical baselines, released checkpoint reproduction,
  and validation-only MIL failure audit are complete.
- The external path is frozen through exact input observability: 70 independent candidates became
  60 preliminary L1C/SCL gate-pass scenes and 55 final CloudSEN12/radiometry gate-pass scenes. The
  remaining input is official ERA5-Land wind; requests and downloader are committed, but CDS
  authentication is user-managed. No methane prediction has been run on this cohort.
- Keep raw data and trained models ignored; commit only manifests, hashes, code, configs, and
  results.
